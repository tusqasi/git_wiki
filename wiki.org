** Difference between origin and upstream

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9257533/what-is-the-difference-between-origin-and-upstream-on-github

- `upstream` generally refers to the original repo that you have forked(the *forked*)
- `origin` is your fork: your own repo on Github, clone of the original repo of Github (the *fork*)
* Commit messages
** A commit style
Commit message can be:
- feat: a new feature
- fix: a bug fix
- docs: changes to documentation
- style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
- refactor: refactoring production code
- test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
- chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change

While looking like this layout:
#+begin_src
    commit type

    body (changes, links, attributions, etc)

    issue tracker id (for reference)
#+end_src
